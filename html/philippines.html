					<p class="lead">On 16 March Magellan reached the island of Homonhon in the Philippines, with 150 crew left. Members of his expedition became the first Europeans to reach the Philippine archipelago. Praising divine intervention for his success, Magellan decided to convert the local population to Christianity. After having luck with one chief, Magellan turned his attention to his first convertâ€™s rival, Lapu Lapu. But Magellan mistakenly believed the rival tribe woud be easily defeated by his arsenal of European cannons and muskets.

					<p class="lead">On April 27, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan was killed by a Filipino tribe, months after he had become the first man to sail from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The surviving members of his crew would sail back to Spain, completing the first circumnavigation of the world.
